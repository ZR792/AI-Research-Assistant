# 🤖 Agentic AI Research Assistant

An intelligent, multi-component AI system designed to autonomously perform research, analysis, and report generation using a modern agentic architecture.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a complete, production-ready **Agentic AI Research Assistant** leveraging the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for robust tool integration. The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns, utilizing a high-performance **FastAPI** backend for the core logic and a responsive **Streamlit** application for the user interface.

### 🌟 Key Technologies

| Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FastAPI** | High-performance Python web framework for scalable API services (Backend) |
| **LangGraph** | Framework for building agentic, multi-step reasoning and stateful workflows |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol for structured tool/function integration (Core Agent) |
| **Streamlit** | Fast and intuitive UI development for Python web applications (Frontend) |
| **Uvicorn** | ASGI server used to run the FastAPI backend |

## 🎨 Features

* **Agentic Reasoning:** Uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate complex, multi-step workflows for thorough research and analysis.
* **MCP Integration:** Implements the **Model Context Protocol** standard for seamless and reliable tool calling (e.g., for web search).
* **Real-time Search:** Fetches live, up-to-date information from the web to ensure report accuracy.
* **Beautiful UI:** Modern, responsive **Streamlit** interface for user interaction, query history, and real-time feedback.
* **Health Monitoring:** Includes a backend health check feature within the UI sidebar.
* **Decoupled Architecture:** Separates the UI and API logic for independent scaling and maintenance.

## ⚙️ Setup and Running the Application

Follow these steps to set up and run the research assistant locally.

### 1. Create and Structure the Project


# 1. Create the main directory
```bash
mkdir Final_Project
cd Final_Project
```
# 2. Create the backend and frontend subdirectories
```bash
mkdir backend frontend
```
2. Set Up the Backend
Place app.py, agent.py, mcp_server.py, and requirements.txt inside the backend/ folder.

Install dependencies:

``cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
``
4. Set Up the Frontend
Place ``streamlit_app.py`` and ``requirements.txt`` inside the frontend/ folder.

Install dependencies:

``cd ../frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
``
5. ▶️ Running the Application
The application requires two separate terminal sessions to run the decoupled services.

Step 4.1: Start the Backend API (Terminal 1)
The FastAPI server provides the research endpoint and orchestrates the agent.
``
cd ../backend
Assuming ``app.py`` is configured to run with Uvicorn

``python app.py ``
